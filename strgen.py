    """
    Generate a secure password for online logins, banking accounts, and so on.
    
    This function doesn't save the generated password, it disposes it after it generates it and returns it to the user (depending on the use of the function).
    

    * Arguments:

    `intLengthOfNumbers` -> must be an integer and it specifies the length of numbers in the generated password.

    `intLengthOfSpecialCharacters` -> must be an integer and it specifies the length of special characters in the generated password.

    `intLengthOfUpperCaseAlphabet` -> must be an integer and it specifies the length of uppercase alphabet characters in the generated password.

    `intLengthOfLowerCaseAlphabet` -> must be an integer and it specifies the length of lowercase alphabet characters in the generated password.

    ### Please note that if you want to use the `randomize` technique you will have to fill these arguments with any value or with zeros, because if you didn't, Python will throw an error that says `generatePassword() requires at least 4 arguments, but 0 were given`

    * Keyword Arguments:

    `randomize` -> Is a Keyword Argument specifying whether to use the randomize technique or no, True if enabled, and False if not, default is True

    * Additional Keyword Arguments related to the functionality of the `randomize` technique:

    `randomizePassLen` -> Is a Keyword Argument specifying the length of the generated password when randomize technique is enabled, default is `0` (This only takes effect if `randomize=True`)

    `noNumbersInRandomize` -> Decides whether to disable including numbers in the generated password by the randomize technique or not, default is `False` (which means they will be included)

    `noSpecialCharactersInRandomize` -> Decides whether to disable including special characters in the generated password by the randomize technique or not, default is `False` (which means they will be included)

    `noUpperCaseCharsInRandomize` -> Decides whether to disable including uppercase alphabet characters in the generated password by the randomize technique or not, default is `False` (which means they will be included)

    `noLowerCaseCharsInRandomize` -> Decides whether to disable including lowercase alphabet characters in the generated password by the randomize technique or not, default is `False` (which means they will be included)

    For example (basic usage syntax with no randomization enabled):

    ```py
    # importing this function from this module.
    from passwordGenerator import generatePassword
    # generating a password then printing it to stdout.
    print(generatePassword(12, 0, 0, 25))
    ```

    Another example (but with randomization enabled):

    ```py
    # importing this function from this module.
    from passwordGenerator import generatePassword
    # generating a password using the randomize technique with the length of 50 and don't exclude anything then print it to stdout.
    print(generatePassword(1, 1, 1, 1, randomize=True, randomizePassLen=50,
        noNumbersInRandomize=False, noSpecialCharactersInRandomize=False, noUpperCaseCharsInRandomize=False, noLowerCaseCharsInRandomize=False))
    ```

    This usually disposes the generated password (from computer memory RAM) after it is printed to stdout.

    When called, this function takes 4 positional arguments, the length of numbers in your password, and the length of special characters in your password, and the length of uppercase alphabet characters, and the length of lowercase alphabet characters in your password.

    This function is a part of "Advanced Password Generator" The command line tool.
